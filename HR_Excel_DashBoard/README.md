Overview
This GIF showcases an HR Analyst Dashboard visualizing employee attrition and workforce metrics. The dashboard includes key statistics, charts, and breakdowns of attrition patterns across demographics, roles, and departments.

Key Metrics
Total Employees: 1,470

Attrition Count: 237

Active Employees: 1,233

Attrition Rate: 16%

Average Age: 37 years

Job Satisfaction: 2.6 (scale undefined)

Dashboard Components
Education-Wise Attrition

Compares attrition rates across education levels:

Associate Degree

High School

Doctoral Degree (labeled as "Decision1 Degree" – possible typo)

Note: Mentions "Attrition Rate per Million in Degree" – likely a visualization error; intended to show attrition rates per education tier.

Gender Distribution

Total employees by gender:

588 (gender unspecified, e.g., Male)

882 (gender unspecified, e.g., Female)

Attrition by Job Role

Visual breakdown of attrition across job roles (specific data not displayed in text).

Annual Status

Unclear from text: Likely shows attrition trends by salary/annual performance.

Attrition by Age

Chart displaying attrition distribution across age groups.

Marital Status Breakdown

Attrition categorized by:

Married

Single

Other

Department-Wise Data

Focuses on three departments:

FIRI (potential typo; may represent HR, Finance, or R&D)

B&D (likely Business & Development)

Sales

Notes
Typos/Errors:

"Decision1 Degree" should likely be "Doctoral Degree."

"Attrition Rate per Million in Degree" appears erroneous; expected metric is likely "% of employees" per education level.

"FIRI" may be a mislabeling of "HR," "Finance," or "R&D."

Visual Clarity: The GIF prioritizes high-level trends over granular data. Exact values for charts (e.g., Job Role, Annual Status) are not explicitly listed in the text.

Purpose
This dashboard helps HR analysts:

Identify attrition hotspots (e.g., by department, education, age).

Monitor workforce health (job satisfaction, active employees).

Support data-driven retention strategies.
